### Linkedin spider:
The first spider aims to visit as more linkedin's user pages as possible :-D, the objective is to gain visibility with your account: since LinkedIn notifies the issued User when someone visits his page.

### Companies spider:
This spider aims to collect all the users working for a company on linkedin.
1. It goes on the company's front-page;
2. Clicks on "See all 1M employees" button;
3. Starts collecting User related Scapy items.


### Install
Needed:
- docker;
- docker-compose;
- VNC viewer, like vinagre (ubuntu);
- python3.6;
- virtualenvs;

##### 0. Prepare your environment:

Install docker from the official website [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/)

Install VNC viewer if you do not have one. 
For ubuntu, go for vinagre:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install vinagre
```

##### 1. Set up Linkedin login and password:
Copy `conf_template.py` in `conf.py` and fill the quotes with your credentials.

##### 2. Run and build containers with docker-compose:
Only linkedin random spider, not the companies spider.
Open your terminal, move to the project folder and type:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```


##### 3. Take a look on the browser's activity:

Open vinagre, and type address and port `localhost:5900`. The password is `secret`.
or otherwise:
```bash
vinagre localhost:5900
or
make view
```

##### 4. Stop the scraper;

Use your terminal again, type in the same window:

```bash
docker-compose down
```


##### Test & Development:
Setup your python virtual environment (trivial but mandatory):

```bash
    virtualenvs -p python3.6 .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create the selenium server, open the VNC window and launch the tests, type those in three different terminals on the project folder:
```bash
    make dev
    make view
    make tests
```

For more details have a look at the Makefile (here is used to shortcut and not to build).
- Development:
```bash
    scrapy crawl companies -a selenium_hostname=localhost -o output.csv
```
or
```bash
    scrapy crawl random -a selenium_hostname=localhost -o output.csv
```
or
```bash
    scrapy crawl byname -a selenium_hostname=localhost -o output.csv
```
