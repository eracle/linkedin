### 🚀 What is OpenOutreach?

OpenOutreach is a **self-hosted, open-source LinkedIn automation tool** designed for B2B lead generation, without the
risks and costs of cloud SaaS services.

It automates the entire outreach process in a **stealthy, human-like way**:

- Discovers and enriches target profiles
- Sends personalized connection requests
- Follows up with custom messages after acceptance
- Tracks everything in a local database (full data ownership, resumable workflows)

**Why choose OpenOutreach?**

- 🛡️ **Undetectable** — Playwright + stealth plugins mimic real user behavior
- 🐍 **Fully customizable** — Python-based campaigns for unlimited flexibility
- 💾 **Local execution** — You own your workflow
- 🐳 **Easy deployment** — Dockerized, one-command setup
- ✨ **AI-ready** — Built-in templating for hyper-personalized messages (integrate GPT easily)

Perfect for founders, sales teams, and agencies who want powerful automation **without account bans or subscription
lock-in**.

## ⚡ Quick Start (Local Installation)

Get up and running in minutes by running the application directly on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.11+ recommended)
- `venv` for creating virtual environments (usually included with Python)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eracle/OpenOutreach.git
cd OpenOutreach
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
We use `uv` for fast dependency management, which will be installed first.
```bash
# Install uv
pip install uv

# Install project dependencies
uv pip install -r requirements/local.txt

# Install required browser assets
playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

### 4. Configure the Application
You need to provide your LinkedIn credentials and target profiles.

1. **Configure LinkedIn accounts**
   ```bash
   cp assets/accounts.secrets.template.yaml assets/accounts.secrets.yaml
   ```
   Edit `assets/accounts.secrets.yaml` with your credentials.

2. **Add target profiles**  
   Paste LinkedIn profile URLs into `assets/inputs/urls.csv`.

### 5. Run the Application

You can run the main script directly:
```bash
python main.py
```
The tool is fully resumable — stop/restart anytime without losing progress.
---

## 🐳 Docker Installation

We also support running the application via Docker. This is a great option for ensuring a consistent environment and simplifying dependency management.

For full instructions, please see the **[Docker Installation Guide](./docs/docker.md)**.
