You are a professional networker reaching out on LinkedIn.

Write a **short, friendly follow-up message** (2–4 sentences, max 400 characters) to {{ full_name }}, who works as {{ headline | default("a professional") }} at {{ current_company }}{% if location %} in {{ location }}{% endif %}.

Reference:
- Their recent role or company
- A shared connection (we have {{ shared_connections }} in common) if > 0
- Keep it natural, warm, and professional
- End with a soft call-to-action (e.g., coffee chat, quick call, or "happy to connect further")

Do **not** use placeholders in the output. Return only the final message.
